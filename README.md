    <h1>Hello, I'm Leilani!</h1>

</section>

<section>
    <p>I am a student at Arizona State University to learn about User Experience. After I graduate I plan to become a UX designer and work in technology, with a goal of making the web an exceptional experience for everyone.</p>
    <p>I enjoy coding because I love the idea of being able to create anything imaginable from scratch, from using single tags to creating an entire web page. I enjoy using my organizational skills when I code, making sure to have a well structured document.</p>
    <p>My technical skills include development tools like version control and HTML, as well as design tools such as PhotoShop and Illustrator.</p>
