    <p> I am a student at Arizona State University to learn about User Experience. After I graduate I plan to become a UX designer and work in technology, with a goal of making the web an exceptional experience for everyone.🌐</p>
    <p> I enjoy coding because I love the idea of being able to create anything imaginable from scratch, from using single tags to creating an entire web page. I enjoy using my organizational skills when I code, making sure to have a well structured document.⌨️</p>
    <p> My technical skills include development tools like version control and HTML, as well as design tools such as PhotoShop and Illustrator.🖥️</p>
    <p>My hobbies include hiking in nature, muay thai, painting, and beading.🎨</p>
